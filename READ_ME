•	Oscillation: Continues rotation of the servo from one end to the opposite around the central offset. The full oscillation angle possible is 180°
(servo dependant) which is virtually mapped from -90° to +90° with 0° being the center of oscillation.

•	Offset: This is the offset from 0° to set as the center of oscillation and can be positive or negative. Note that any offset added, 
reduces the 180° arc of movement by the offset amount.

•	Trim: Some servos do not have a level of precision and setting the offset to 0° for example, does not leave the horn exactly center. 
The trim can be used to adjust this position in 1° increments, positive or negative - in future, the granularity of this adjustment may
be made smaller to allow fractions of a degree.

•	Amplitude: This is the degrees of movement to travel from the offset in both positive and negative direction.
With an offset of 0°, the max amplitude is 90° which will result in a full oscillation arc of 180° (-90° to +90°). 
Note that the amplitude can be greater than 90°, but the underlying servo library or the servo itself will ignore angles outside it's range.
In this case, then the movement reaches the max servo position, it would stop, the oscillation calculation would continue with further invalid angles 
sent to the serve until the oscillation max is reached and movement direction changes. Only once the angle comes back into range, will the servo start
moving back toward the offset position.

•	Period: The amount of time in milliseconds, that one full oscillation cycle takes. Note that one full cycle is 4 * the amplitude.

Phase: This is the position within the cycle where the movement starts. This is mostly useful when there are two or more servos, oscillating at the same time 
with the same amplitude and period, but one or more needs to start at a different positions within the cycle if they are all started together.
